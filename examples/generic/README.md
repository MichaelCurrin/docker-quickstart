# Generic

A container that is a good base for experimenting or adding to.

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) includes some typical steps to get going. It includes `git` so you can easily clone projects into it. Though for a larger project you would copy your local app into the container rather.


```sh
$ cd examples/generic
```

```sh
$ docker build .
```
Example:
```
...
Successfully built 1a9a100194b6
```
